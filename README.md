backup53
==========

#Purpose 

DNS is just sort of important as it's the glue that resolves names to IP addresses. Ensuring the integrity of DNS and the ability to backup and restore it is critical for organizations that do not have a secondary DNS provider. Since Amazon does not provide a tool to backup and restore your hosted zones this tool allows you to backup and dynamically restore them; persisting nameserver glue records between zones. It is still early in testing and a recovery from a total DNS record/zone loss still requres a few manual steps (pointing root level domain registrar records at new nameservers, etc.) but it is a step in the right direction.

#Features

Upcoming:

* JSON file per zone
* Upsert ability instead of Create
* Diff Zones (view what has changed)

Current

* Backs up Amazon Route53 DNS Zones/Records to JSON
* Restore Zones/Records safely by creating new zones and recreating the glue between sub-domains and parent domains
* Stores all DNS Zones/Records in the following JSON format:
